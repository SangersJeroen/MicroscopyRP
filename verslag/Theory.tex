\section{Theory}
In  theTheorie  (Theory)  chapter,  you  describe  all  (and  only!)  the  theory needed  to  understand  and  interpret the experiments  in  the  remainder  of  the  report.    Explain  to  the  reader  why  a  piece  of  theory  is  relevant  for  your  research.  Equations  should  be  numbered.  If  an  equation  cannot  be  assumed  to  be  generally known by the readers (see General Hint 2 for the level of the audience), you should provide a reference to an accessible textbook or article (so not to the RP manual, lecture notes, Wikipedia etc.). In general, try to avoid referring to websites, online data or Wikipedia.
