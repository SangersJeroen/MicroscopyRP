\section{Results and discussion}
In theResultaten en discussie (Results and discussion) chapter, you present your results, generally in the form of graphs, and you discuss them. A single small table (m aximum ~10 rows x ~5 columns) is acceptable, but large tables should be in an appendix. In deviation from what many students believe, it is not desirable to separate the presentation and the discussion of results from each other. In professional literature, this is most often done together.\\ •You should introduce each graph:\\ -Why has this graph been included in the report. (What do we want to learn from this graph?).\\-Why   have   you   plotted   this   Y-axis   variable   as   a   function   of   this   X-axis   variable   (which   theoretical/expected relationship is tested/demonstrated in this this graph? \\•Then you tell the reader what (according to you) he/she should see in the graph, limiting yourself toconclusions  that  are  relatively  indisputable.  The  more  speculative  conclusions  should  be  in the  next  chapter.
