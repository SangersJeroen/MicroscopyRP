\section*{Abstract}
The report starts with a Samenvatting (Abstract).  The abstract should be self-contained, i.e. a reader should be able to fully understand it without any prior knowledge about the research. Also, in the abstract there should be no references to (figures, tables, formulas etc. in) the remainder of the report, nor to the literature.  The  abstract  tells  the  reader:\\ (1) which  research  question  has  been  studied,\\  (2) what  the  research method/approach was,\\ (3) which results have been obtained, and \\(4) what the main conclusions were.
