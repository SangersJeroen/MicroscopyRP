\section{Introduction}
TheInleiding ( Introduction) describes:   -The  research  question.  (Be  as  precise  as  possible.  Not:  “We  investigate  on  which  parameters  the  bubble  behaviour  depends”,  but  “we  study  the  relationship  between  the  path  of  bubbles  at  a  microfluidic T-junction, and the velocity and length of those bubbles).\\-The relevance of the research question (for science and/or technology).\\-The state-of-art: what is already know? (including references to prior literature).\\-A brief description of the research method/approach.\\-A brief description of the structure/contents of the rest of the report.\\The  introduction  should  be  self-contained,  without  reference  to  the  manual  or  to  the  remainder  of  the  report, and should be understandable to readers who know nothing about the research.
