\section{Experimental method}
TheExperimentele  opstellingor Experimentele  methode (Experimental  set  up  or  Experimental method) chapter describes the experimental setup and the experimental methods used in sufficient detail such that a reader can judge the soundness and, in principle, may verify the conclusions of your research. Also,  this  chapter  should  be  informative  for  a  reader  who  wants  to  perform  similar  research.  Preferably  use clear sketches of the setup, rather than photographs. In this chapter you also describe the accuracywith which direct observables have been measured, and the accuracy of the important deduced quantities. Detailed accuracy calculations should be put in an Appendix
